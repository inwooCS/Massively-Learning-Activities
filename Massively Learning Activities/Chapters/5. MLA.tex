\section{Massively Learning Activities I - Initial Deployment} \label{section: MLA}
The System Development Life-cycle (SDLC) is a project management model that defines different stages that are necessary to bring a project from conception to deployment and later maintenance. The SDLC model consists of several phases, which typically include requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The specific activities within each phase may vary depending on the project and the organization, but the basic principles are the same. The SDLC model is a flexible framework that can be adapted to suit the needs of different projects and organizations. It provides a systematic approach to software development that helps ensure that software is built efficiently, effectively, and with minimal risk.

Massively Learning Activities will follow a similar variation to the SDLC project management model where each SDLC stage will correspond to a subsection in this chapter.

\subsection{Planning I} 

TASI has been contracted by CNMI to create an infrastructure that will allow for data analytics on Protected Health Information (PHI). To achieve this, TASI will provide a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution, by hosting SAS services on on-premises hardware, configured for multi-tenancy.

The tenants, including APCD, CMNI, CMA, Criminal Justice, and several education environments, will provide the necessary data, which will be submitted to an ETL data pipeline for data migration, cleaning, and processing. Once the data has been processed, tenants may perform data analytics using advanced algorithms in SAS programming language.

To ensure secure operations, we will configure the security relationships between the software, hardware, and tenants using LDAP, security groups, encryption  and other related tools. Our goal is to architect a high-performance infrastructure that allows for advanced data analytics while maintaining the confidentiality and security of PHI.

Due to SAS being a time sensitive project, the initial deployment will have SAS suites and VMs installed on existing hardware, with plans to migrate the infrastructure to newly acquired hardware in the future.

The initial deployment of SAS technologies will expect 4 tenants:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)
    \item All-Payer Claims Database (APCD)
    \item Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMA)
    \item Med-Quest
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirement of Analysis I}

The Requirement Analysis phase is a crucial component in developing a robust SAS infrastructure using the SDLC framework. This phase involves gathering and analyzing the specific requirements for the project, including pre-installation checklists and EEC sizing requirements. In this phase, ongoing project management tasks will be performed, such as preparing a project plan and assigning appropriate resources. 

Furthermore, as part of this phase, SAS will send a Pre-Install Requirements Document to the client for completion, and both parties will ensure environmental readiness for installation by reviewing the completed document. 

Additionally, SAS will send a billable work hours log for verification based on the project plan. This subsection will provide a detailed overview of the pre-installation checklist and EEC sizing requirements necessary for a successful implementation of the SAS infrastructure.

\subsubsection{EEC Sizing: SAS 9.4 (Summarized)}
This document provides sizing guidance for SAS Office Analytics/Data Management Advanced. The estimate provided assumes a typical implementation of SAS Office Analytics/Data Management Advanced and does not take into account any additional workloads or components that may be added. The estimate is based on a preferred hardware vendor with a given performance characteristic. It is recommended that the environment be closely monitored and scaled to support the required workloads to meet the business objectives.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item This response is based on Intel Xeon E5-2600v4 or Gold 6200/6300 series processor with a clock speed of at least 3.30 GHz running Windows Server 2019, 64 bit operating system.
        \item Core counts are guidelines only. These requirements may vary depending on the solutions installed or the number of users/sessions supported in accordance with Operating System Guidelines and SAS recommendations, page file space should be set to 1.5 to 2 times the amount of physical memory. The machines should be configured for maximum memory bandwidth; this will be dependent on the actual processors/machines selected.
    \end{itemize}
    \item SAS Environment and Configuration Assumptions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item SAS tends to be I/O intensive. Consider the peak I/O throughput requirements of their system and work with their storage provider to ensure that the storage environment can provide the level of I/O required. A significant percentage of “performance problems” reported to SAS Technical Support can be directly attributed to insufficient levels of I/O throughput.
        \item Recommended I/O throughput rates for the SAS Data and SAS WORK file systems are as follows: for permanent SAS data files, your application throughput requirements may dictate a minimum I/O throughput rate of 100-150 MBs/sec per core, minimum, in the system. Reads and writes to the file system will occur during the ETL process. Chronic and heavy reads and writes are common for the SAS WORK file system. 
        \item Depending on the architecture and deployment, multiple compute tiers need access to a common data area. This may require the use of a centralized storage mechanism such as a Clustered File System (CFS).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This sizing estimate is based on a combination of guidelines provided by SAS R\&D, SAS Product Management, test data, and field experience. Our best practice is to provide the topology as developed by R\&D and try to provide as unified a presentation of the requirements as possible. When questions on deployment arises, the Sizing team defers to the account team.

\subsubsection{EEC Sizing: SAS Viya 3.5 (Summarized)}

This document provides sizing guidance for SAS Viya 3.5. The estimate is not a performance benchmark and does not provide any performance guarantee. The University of Hawai’i at Manoa is responsible for all costs associated with procuring any hardware. This estimate assumes that appropriate data management activities will happen outside of SAS In Memory, and resources for data management activities are not included in this exercise.

        \item Additional Recommendations: Server power settings need to be set to maximum, hyper-threading should be enabled for all production CPU's, storage drives should be SSD's instead of HDD's.
        \item Two additional servers are configured: 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item SAS Programming Runtime Environment (SPRE) is the environment where SAS programs are executed. (4 cores, 96 GB RAM, 2 x 480 GB SSD). 
            \item Dev/Test is a sandbox server to test the development environment before production \\(16 cores, 192 GB RAM, 2 x 480 GB SSD).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{enumerate}

This sizing estimate is based on a combination of guidelines provided by SAS R\&D, SAS Product Management and test data. Changes to the workload (in either number of sessions or data volumes), operating system, or preferred vendor or chipset may render this sizing as void. In the event of changes, the SAS Account Team should resubmit the questionnaire with the needed updates for reprocessing. 

\subsubsection{TASI's Infrastructure}
\label{TASI's Infrastructure Section Header}

TASI's infrastructure consists of (1) Dell PowerEdge FX2 Enclosure. The FX2 Enclosure is a 2U rack-based server located inside a server rack at the ITS data center (ITS M01). The FX2 Enclosure consists of (4) blades, which are modular server components that are installed within the FX2 Enclosure as seen Figure \ref{Current ENV}. Each blade is a self-contained server that contains one or more CPUs, memory, storage, and other components required to run applications and services as seen in Figure \ref{BLD-RSRC}.

Despite each blade in the FX2 Enclosure already being allocated to other TASI projects, the unused resources will be logically separated to establish a multi-tenant environment that can facilitate SAS technologies.

\subsubsection{Well-Architected Framework}

TASI will design a multi-tenant infrastructure that will accommodate all the VMs specified in the multi-tenancy configuration plan in Section \ref{Multi-Tenancy Configuration Plan}. The design should incorporate the main principles of a well-architected framework, which include high availability, redundancy, optimization, security, and compliance.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item High Availability and Redundancy
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider that although virtualizing the CAS Controller and Backup Controller on the same hardware can offer several benefits, such as cost savings, simplified management, and easier backup and recovery processes, it will be better to virtualize them on separate hardware to provide high availability and redundancy of CAS controllers (Figure \ref{TNTS-NDS}), in the case of unexpected downtime. As for CAS Workers, it is recommended to virtualize them on separate hardware to reduce resource conflicts but it is not necessary. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Optimization
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The performance overhead of using SAS Viya 3.5 and CAS on VMs instead of dedicated hardware can depend on several factors including workload characteristics, available hardware resources, and the virtualization technology used.
        \textcolor{red}{In section 6.3.1, if the advantage of distributing the SAS components across blades is for load balancing, it would be good to include a comment to that effect -- otherwise, it would probably be more efficient to have them all on the same blade.}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Security and Compliance
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In a logically separated multi-tenant environment, MLA must ensure network and data isolation between each tenant, data encryption for data at rest and in transit, a well configured access control list for hardware and software, and compliance certification for handling PHI data (i.e., HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC 2, HITECH, Hawaii Information Privacy Act, etc). 

    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Deployment Design I}

The Deployment Design phase is a critical step in implementing a successful SAS infrastructure. During this phase, the technical specifications and architecture of the system are defined, and the appropriate hardware and software components are selected. This phase also includes creating a deployment plan, which outlines the steps for installing and configuring the system.

\subsubsection{Deployment Design (STC)}

The initial deployment of MLA will involve the installation of SAS 9.4 and SAS Viya 3.5 on existing infrastructure. The deployment configuration for each tenant will be tailored to meet their individual requirements. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure} 

To maximize resource efficiency, CAS nodes will be evenly distributed across each blade, where a blade will consist of one controller, one backup controller, and two workers. The controller and backup controller, configured on the same system, will belong to separate tenants. The workers will also belong to separate tenants but each blade will have at least one related controller and worker per system. 

Subsequently, four additional VMs will be created to support the installation of SAS Viya 3.5 and SAS DMA. SAS Viya 3.5 will be installed as software on top of a RHEL 3.7X VM instance, in Blade 1. SAS DMA consists of three software components that will installed as software on top of Windows Server 2019 VM instances, in Blades' 2, 3, and 4.
