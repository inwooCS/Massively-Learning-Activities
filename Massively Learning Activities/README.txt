In todayâ€™s data-driven world, the effective utilization of technology and information systems is paramount
to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions. Within the realm of healthcare, the ability to
analyze vast amounts of data, such as Protected Health Information (PHI), can lead to improved patient
care, enhanced policy planning, and more efficient healthcare systems. By harnessing the power of
SAS analytics, this project aims to revolutionize data management and analytics capabilities, enabling
researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to gain valuable insights and drive innovation in the healthcare
domain.
