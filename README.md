# Project: Massively Learning Activities

Aloha! Welcome to my GitHub repository, home to my master's capstone project called "Massively Learning Activities." My name is In Woo Park, and I am excited to share the details of this endeavor with you.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a hyper-converged infrastructure that will host SAS technologies, enabling invaluable data analytics for agencies in the Pacific Islands, such as APCD, CMS, CNMI, and more. In collaboration with the Research Corporation of the University of Hawaii (RCUH), the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and these agencies, we aim to establish an advanced infrastructure capable of delivering powerful data analytics solutions.

The purpose of this infrastructure goes beyond providing support for social-political work; our vision extends to creating an analytics environment for future university students. By offering access to cutting-edge analytics tools, we hope to inspire the next generation of data enthusiasts and empower them to explore and leverage data for solving complex challenges.

Within this repository, you will find the culmination of our efforts, including documentation, code, and project resources. Feel free to explore and engage with the project, as we believe that collaboration and knowledge sharing are essential for driving innovation and creating a better future.

Thank you for visiting, and we hope you find this repository informative and inspiring. If you have any questions or would like to contribute, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's embark on this data analytics journey together!

Mahalo,

In Woo Park
