\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{red}{We are contracted by CNMI to create an infrastructure where we can perform data analytics on PHI. This infrastructure is hosted on-prem first, hybrid later.}
    \item \textcolor{red}{Tenants (e.g. APCD, CMNI, CMA, Criminal Justice) has the data ready.}
    \item \textcolor{red}{Data is submitted from tenants to ETL (data-pipeline) to be processed then sent to SAS (on-prem servers).}
    \item \textcolor{red}{Data analytics is performed on the data using advanced algorithms in SAS programming language}. 
    \item \textcolor{red}{Project is time sensitive, deadline is requiring TASI to move onto the development stage with existing on-prem hardware as proof-of-concept ASAP}.
    \item \textcolor{red}{Initially architect the infrastructure using existing on-prem hardware to speed up deployment}
    \item \textcolor{red}{Once deployed, stable, and proof-of-concept ready, move onto the production stage by acquiring new hardware and migrating the previous (virtualized) SAS deployment to the new hardware using vMotion.}.
    \item \textcolor{red}{Configure the security relationship between the software, hardware, and tenants (Active Directory, LDAP, Security Groups, etc}.
